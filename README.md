### SVfit_py

# Installation
SVfit_py requires the installation of [SVfit](https://github.com/SVfit/ClassicSVfit/tree/fastMTT_19_02_2019) (fastMTT_19_02_2019).

# Running SVfit_py
Once the installation of C++ SVfit is completed and the libraries (libTauAnalysisClassicSVfit.so and libTauAnalysisSVfitTF.so, which should be located in CMSSW_9_4_4/lib/slc6_amd64_gcc700 or whichever CMSSW_X_X_X version is being used) are generated, they should be loaded in the python script along with the SVfit_py.cc script as shown in example.py.
